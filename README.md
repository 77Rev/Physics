Random physics projects, codes


## Biot-Savart Law Visualisation | Biot-Savart_Visualisation.ipynb

The code contains a function, with description. To use it properly, you have to know how to parameterise curves.
It creates an interactive plot, showing the magnetic field around the wire.

## Chaotic maps | Tinkerbell.ipynb

It is a very simple code for creating chaotic maps.
The program uses scienceplots, which standard anaconda based jupyter notebook installation usually lack.
You can remove it easily, but if you want to use it, just acrivate your environment
and run "pip install SciencePlots". It should work afterwards.
